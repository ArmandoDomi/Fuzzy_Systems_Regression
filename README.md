# Fuzzy_Systems_Regression
TSK models that are using the hybrid method for training.
For the task 1 use [
Airfoil Self-Noise Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Airfoil+Self-Noise).
For the task 2 use [Superconductivty Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Superconductivty+Data)
## Task 1  Model 1
- Use grid partition 
- Change the output function to constant
- Use 2 membership function
- Use gbellmf as membership function type
- Train the TSK model with hybrid method
- Evaluate the model
  - R2
  - RMSE
  - NMSE
  - NDEI
## Task 1  Model 1
- Use grid partition 
- Change the output function to constant
- Use 3 membership function
- Use gbellmf as membership function type
- Train the TSK model with hybrid method
- Evaluate the model
  - R2
  - RMSE
  - NMSE
  - NDEI
## Task 1  Model 3
- Use grid partition 
- Change the output function to linear
- Use 2 membership function
- Use gbellmf as membership function type
- Train the TSK model with hybrid method
- Evaluate the model
  - R2
  - RMSE
  - NMSE
  - NDEI
## Task 1  Model 4
- Use grid partition 
- Change the output function to linear
- Use 3 membership function
- Use gbellmf as membership function type
- Train the TSK model with hybrid method
- Evaluate the model
  - R2
  - RMSE
  - NMSE
  - NDEI
## Task 2
  - Use Subtractive Clustering 
  - Create a grid search for the best number of features and values of radii
  - Use relieff for feature selection
  - Compare metrics between models to find the best parameters
